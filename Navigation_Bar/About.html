            <img alt="John Wright">
            <p2>John Wright transferred to the University of Maryland after his freshman year at Western Maryland College (now McDaniel College). He moved into the House as a boarder, joined the Fall 1977 pledge class, and was initiated into Eta Chapter in January of 1978. John lived in the House, “off and on”, for four years (maybe a little longer). He served as Social Chairman and assisted other officers in Rush and Homecoming activities. He and Joe Criscuoli planned and held a Freshmen Rush mixer on the Row that rivaled the crowds seen at the campus riots in '69. After graduation, he attended The University of Baltimore Law School, obtaining his Juris Doctor degree and was admitted to the Maryland Bar in 1989. He currently practices law in Landover, Maryland as a trial lawyer in over 8 counties. John married Janie, whom he met at Maryland while she was in the Pom Squad with the Marching Band and active in the Eta Chapter's “Little Sister” program. They have 3 children. The oldest two, Jennifer and Annie, graduated from Maryland in 2009 & 2010, respectively. Their youngest, John (Jr.), graduated from Maryland in 2015 after serving the Eta Chapter as President.

        <br>
            As a student, I have recognized a need for accessible and realiable health information, particularly for individuals with low health literacy. 
        Through diligent research, I have created this platform with the aim of making healthcare information and appropriate medical decision making more approachable and understandable for all.
